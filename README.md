Spade Magick is a platform created for magicians, amateurs and even fans of magic. Here, magicians are able to post their creations to either show them of even post instructions and media on how to perform each illusion. All illusions are devided by categories which will allow the user to find an illusion quicker and get to enjoy the magic faster.

This web application was built using Express and PostgreSQL in the backend, and JavaScript, React and Redux in the frontend. This application includes three full features, with a few more that are in development.
